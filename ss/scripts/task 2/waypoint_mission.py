This is a boiler plate script that contains hint about different services that are to be used
to complete the task.
Use this code snippet in your code or you can also continue adding your code in the same file


This python file runs a ROS-node of name waypoint_Mission which sends the waypoints to drone
in mission mode.
This node publishes and subsribes the following topics:

	 Services to be called         Subscriptions				
	/mavros/cmd/arming             /mavros/state
    /mavros/set_mode
    /mavros/mission/push
